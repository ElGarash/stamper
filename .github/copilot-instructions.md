# Stamper React Native App - Copilot Instructions

## Architecture Overview

- It's based on **Ignite boilerplate** (https://github.com/infinitered/ignite).

- The specification is in `spec.md` and the to-do list is in `todo.md`.

## Development

- Work in step by step, and validate each step before moving to the next one.
- Ignore lint and formatting issues Completely. Unless I ask explicitly to fix them.
- If you want to access the logs use `npx react-native log-android`.
- To interact with the app use `mcp-appium-visual`.
- Always assume the Expo development is running and connect to the emulator.
